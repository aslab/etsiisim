# etsiisim
A simulation model of the ETSII UPM for robotics research

## Purpose

The **ETSIISim** project will develop a simulation model of the ETSII to be used in robotics research.

## A Basic Scenario

A researcher wants to perform experiments on robot control in exterior/interior enviroments. The use of ETSIISim simplfies the contruction of the environent to help the research focus on the contruction of the robot controller.

## Work

The work is to build a pretty complete model of the ETSII in one or more robotics simulators.

- Investigate simulators
- Identify researcher needs
- Coose modeling strategy
- Develop model
- Create usability materials
